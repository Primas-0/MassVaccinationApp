I. Effort Grading

   Program does not compile or does not run, or runs but does not
   produce output even after minor tweaks. Grading based on effort.
   Deductions from scripted grading and deductions marked below are
   ignored. Late penalties still apply.

   Choose one only:

   ~~  60:  Removing one or two major bugs will fix this project.
   ~~  45:  Significant progress made, but major rewrite is necessary.
   ~~  30:  Not much progress made. 
   ~~  15:  Barely started coding. 
   ~~   0:  Morally equivalent to no submission.

II. Tests in mytest.cpp

   == -1: Test insertion operation works correctly
   == -2: Test insertion operation works correctly with colliding keys
   == -1: Test remove operation works correctly
   == -2: Test remove operation works correctly with colliding keys
   == -2: Test rehash triggers once load factor passes 0.5 and rehash completes  
   == -2: Test rehash triggers once deleted ratio passes 0.8 and rehash completes
   == -2: Test the find operation (getPatient function) works correctly
   == -2: Test the find operation (getPatient function) for error case (car does not exist)
   == -2: Test find operation works correctly with colliding keys
   == -2: Test change of probing policy works correctly transfers the data to the correct buckets


          Comment: Good job with testing for all test cases.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------

IV. Coding Standards

 X == -0:  Good indentation, comments, and choice of variable names

   == -2:  Poor or inconsistent indentation

   == -2:  Program uses global variables or static data members in lieu of 
           parameters and return values

   == -2:  In-line comments are terse and not meaningful
   == -3:  In-line comments are non-existent

   == -1:  Poor choice of variable names
   
           Comment: Good coding standards used.
